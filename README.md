# ðŸ“Š Supervised Machine Learning Projects (From Scratch)

This repository contains my hands-on implementations of supervised machine learning algorithms and concepts, built from scratch using Python. These projects were completed as part of my self-learning journey while studying the **Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification** course by DeepLearning.AI on Coursera.

## ðŸ“Œ About This Repository

Most implementations were done **from scratch** using only `NumPy` and `Matplotlib` for core computations and visualizations â€” without relying on any high-level ML libraries.  
Some later projects include **introductory uses of `scikit-learn`** for comparison and demonstration purposes.
